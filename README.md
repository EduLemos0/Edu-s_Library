# Edu's Library

## A win-win project

I've started this project mainly with the plain purpose of creating a huuuge library system that could possibly work in some places that I attend. But seeing this gave me an idea, **_before organizing other's people books, I should manage my own personal library first..._**. While organizing my stuff, a friend of mine [Luiz](https://github.com/lffg) told me about a new ORM called [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) which proved to be very easy to use, with a pleasant syntax and smart database management.

It might take a while to finish, but stay tuned!
